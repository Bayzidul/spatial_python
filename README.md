SpatialPython
=============

Welcome to the Spatial Python community on `Github`. Here you will find links and pages with `Python` resources for geospatial data and analysis. This is a community effort that was started at `SciPy2014`, in Austin Texas, July 2014.

For now, you can find a listing of [Essential Python Geospatial Libraries](packages.md), and a simple set of [Install Instructions](install.md). In the future, the goal is to create a list of packages useful for particular components of the geospatial workflow, including packages for 'Representing spatial data', 'Handling spatial data', 'Reading and writing spatial data', 'Point pattern analysis', 'Geostatistics', 'Spatial regression', 'Spatial ecology', 'Regional analysis', 'Clustering', etc.

If you'd like to contribute, please don't hesitate to get involved: email an existing organization member or a submit pull request.

Happy coding!
